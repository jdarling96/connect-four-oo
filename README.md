# connect-four-oo
A browser based Connect Four game refactored using Object Oriented Programming.   
 
Connect Four is played on a grid, 7 wide by 6 deep, with two players, 1 (red) and 2 (blue). The players alternate turns, dropping a piece of their color in the top of a column. The piece will fall down to the further-down unoccupied slot.The game is won when a player makes four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without a winner.

Refactoring, or rewriting, code is a vital skill for keeping codebases up to date. You don't want to rewrite code from scratch when you could just fix and improve something that's already there. In this project, Im going to refactor my Connect Four game to make it object-oriented! Through this project you can see for yourself how much smoother everything is when you use OOP.
